# Vehicle Sales Advertisements Dashboard

This is a simple web application built with Streamlit that visualizes a dataset of vehicle sales advertisements.

## Features

The application displays two types of plots:

1. **Histogram of Car Model Years**: This plot shows the distribution of the model years of the cars in the dataset.

2. **Odometer Readings vs Car Prices Scatter Plot**: This plot shows the relationship between the odometer readings and the prices of the cars.

There is a checkbox that allows you to toggle between these two plots.

## Installation
